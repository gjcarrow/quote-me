# Quote Me

A random quote generator you can stick anywhere on your page if you're so inclined.

## Installation

To install, just clone this repo to get the 2 files you need.

## Usage

To use, just add the quoteMe.js and quoteMe.css files to your directories. 
If you want the quote generator at the top of the page, like in the demo, you
needn't do anything. A container div will be dynamically added to the page, and
be inserted before the first child of the body element. To have the quote generator
anywhere else in the page, just create a div with an id of "quoteGenerator," and place it whereever you want it to be displayed on your page. 

The quoteMe.css file contains the animation style rules if you like the animation look. Hack away at the quoteMe.css file to make it look and act the way you like, or leave it alone to keep it looking and animating like the demo.
