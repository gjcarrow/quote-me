{"name":"Quote-me","tagline":"A random quote generator to plug anywhere on your page","body":"# Quote Me\r\n\r\nA random quote generator you can stick anywhere on your page if you're so inclined.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, just [clone the repo](https://github.com/gjcarrow/quote-me.git) to get the 2 files you need.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use, just add the quoteMe.js and quoteMe.css files to your directories. \r\nIf you want the quote generator at the top of the page, like in the demo, you\r\nneedn't do anything. A container div will be dynamically added to the page, and\r\nbe inserted before the first child of the body element. To have the quote generator\r\nanywhere else in the page, just create a div with an id of \"quoteGenerator,\" and place it whereever you want it to be displayed on your page. \r\n\r\nThe quoteMe.css file contains the animation style rules if you like the animation look. Hack away at the quoteMe.css file to make it look and act the way you like, or leave it alone to keep it looking and animating like the demo.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2.
